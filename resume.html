        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>Cloud Engineer / Upgrade team, PTC, February 2023 - Today</h3>
        <p>
            Deployed and monitored software version upgrades to FRM customers. These customers had custom solutions for Windchill and Thingworx, thus needed extensive testing and high level project planning to roll out version upgrades that would impact their production servers in the least amount of time. This required extensive planning and broad orchestration of multiple departments and individuals to secure the required virtual infrastructure as well as database backups. 
        </p>

        <h3>Cloud Engineer / Apps team, PTC, October 2020 - February 2023</h3>
        <p>
            Worked with the FRM (Federal, Aerospace, and Defense Industry Solutions) as a cloud engineer for PTC's Windchill and Thingworx cloud based solutions. These customers were hosted in DoD (Department of Defense) compliant IL4 (Impact Level 4) and IL5 cloud servers. My main role was handling customer and internal company tickets that revolved around Windchill and Thingworx functionality as well as deploying updates and custom build packages. Promonent customers were the Navy, Army, Austal, NASA, and Aerojet.
        </p>

        <h3>Remote Robot Technician, Bossa Nova Robotics, March 2020 - June 2020</h3>
        <p>
            Helped remotely troubleshoot then fix errors thrown by Bossa Nova's autonomous robots. These robots were deployed inside Walmarts across the U.S. and were used to generate data (4k panoramic pictures of grocery isles) that the onboard A.I. would process for valuable insights which was then given to Walmart. InOrbit was used to keep track of the various fleets and Salesforce was used to issue tickets and organize problems for internal wikis.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Center Report Builder, PITT OHIO, May 2019, August 2019</h3>
        <p>
            Worked in PITT OHIO's data center using T-SQL and Report Building software to modernize old report templates.
        </p>

        <h3>Application Developer Intern, PITT OHIO, May 2018 - August 2018</h3>
        <p>
            Worked with other interns to complete a company-wide project that tracked customer data (tickets, bills of lading, claims, etc.) throughout the company's workflow. This was done to identify shortfalls in the company's handling of customer data and to streamline existening avenues of said data.
